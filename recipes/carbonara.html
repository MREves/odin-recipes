  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>There may be no more beloved Italian dish than carbonara: hot pasta tossed with a creamy sauce of raw beaten eggs, accentuated with crisp bits of guanciale, and finished with a shower of grated aged Pecorino Romano cheese plus freshly ground black pepper.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 ounces guanciale, cut into 1/4-inch cubes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>6 ounces spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 cup reserved pasta water</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook guanciale with olive oil and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a Dutch oven over medium-low heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
    <li>Whisk eggs, 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, 3 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese, and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.</li>
    <li>Pour reserved pasta water and drained spaghetti into the bacon-pepper mixture; stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Slowly pour egg mixture into the pasta mixture; cook, stirring constantly until the egg mixture forms a thick sauce, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Stir remaining 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and 3 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese into the pasta mixture and serve.</li>
  </ol>
